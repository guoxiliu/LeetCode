 *
 * Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
 * 
 * A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with
 * any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its
 * digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will
 * stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those
 * numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
 * 
 * Example:Â 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 19
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 
 * 1^2 + 9^2 = 82
 * 8^2 + 2^2 = 68
 * 6^2 + 8^2 = 100
 * 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
