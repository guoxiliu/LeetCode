 * Testcase Example:  '[1,1,1,6,1,1,1]'
 *
 * There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is
 * beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of
 * length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the i^th house.
 * 
 * Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.
 * 
 * The distance between the i^th and j^th houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is
 * the absolute value of x.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: colors = [1,1,1,6,1,1,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
 * The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
 * House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is
 * abs(0 - 3) = 3.
 * Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: colors = [1,8,3,8,3]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and
 * color 3 is green.
 * The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.
 * House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is
 * abs(0 - 4) = 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: colors = [0,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and
 * house 1.
 * House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is
 * abs(0 - 1) = 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n ==Â colors.length
 * 2 <= n <= 100
 * 0 <= colors[i] <= 100
 * Test data are generated such that at least two houses have different
 * colors.
